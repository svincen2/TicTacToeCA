# Build
Probably the easiest way to build is to import into IntelliJ.
Of course, you'll need IntelliJ.

Alternatively, you should be able to use javac to compile Main.java.
Notice, however, that all source files exist in the package 'sample',
so to run, you will need to do something like "java sample.Main" from the
directory containing sample/ (i.e. the src/ directory).
