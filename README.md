# Build
Probably the easiest way to build is to import into IntelliJ.  Of course, you'll need IntelliJ.

Alternatively, you should be able to use javac to compile the java source files.  This should work from src/sample directory: `javac *.java`

Then, from the src/ directory, run: `java sample.Main`

Have some fun!
